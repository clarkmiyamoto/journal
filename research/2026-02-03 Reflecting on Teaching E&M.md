#teaching

I looked through my teaching reviews for Fall 2025 E&M (at the Junior/3rd year level).

Objectively looking at the scores, I did fine (averaged 4/5, where 3 is called "neutral"). But I felt my performance wasn't that good. Couple reasons:
- I felt my explanations weren't landing w/ students
- Students' test performances were low
- Students' homework was obviously copied from solution manual.
Bullet points (2,3) really stem from (1). If there were more valuable explanations, then students would perform much higher. The question is really how to make more valuable explanations.

Let's look at some comments and see if we can extract insight. These ones stood out to me:
- If you could suggest one thing to improve the recitation, what would it be?
	1. "More practice problems."
	2. "The TA was not able to explain his intuition for the problem at our level of reasoning."
- Is there anything else you would like to share with the INSTRUCTOR?
	3. "The biggest thing that I think would've helped me is if you could've scale your explanations of what was going on to the level of a high schooler with grasp of algebra-1. I felt like you were teaching me at a baseline of understanding that is graduate level (mathematical fluency of calculus) but I don't have that just yet."

Some comments on my (semi unintentional) choices
1. I tired to not do too many practice problems because I feel the purpose of homework is to give students a chance to start fresh a new problem. People always say the hardest part of a problem is figuring out how to start it, but if you never get the chance to start from scratch, then you'll never learn that skill!
   However, I think there is a good middle ground. I just need to think how to make it happen...
2. I agree, and this is why I feel I did poorly. It's quite difficult, cause you have to go into the headspace of not knowing anything, and then go back, all while not seemingly like you're mansplaning / assuming the students know nothing. 
3. So I agree that I treated them with more mathematical maturity than I think was necessary. However, expecting fluency in calculus in a Junior level course should be expected.
   How do you balance catching students up in calculus, vs teaching new material?? Perhaps the purpose of recitation is to catch students up.
