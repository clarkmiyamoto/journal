Had a chat w/ Matthew, Jaewoo, Shadi about constructing diffeomorphism invariant functions. They said that anything you construct with Einstein summation notation will inherently be diffeomorphsim invariant.

In particular if you want gradients, you need to use the Covariant derivative. This is described in *Carroll: Chapter 3.2 (Curvature, Covariant Derivatives)*. 

# Notes
**Covariant Derivative**
$$
\nabla_\mu V^\nu = \partial_\mu V^\nu + \Gamma_{\mu \lambda}^\nu V^\lambda
$$
where $\Gamma_{\mu \lambda}^\nu$ is the Christoffel symbols defined by
$$
\Gamma^{\lambda}_{\mu \nu}
$$
