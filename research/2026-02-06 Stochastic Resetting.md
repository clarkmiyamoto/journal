#generative 

Adam told me an interesting fact. Consider you have a particle initalizes at $x_0$ and it diffuses. You want to see the expected time for the particle to hit a boundary (not the boundary is not symmetric around $x_0$), you can decrease the time to hit the boundary by literally restarting the simulation. This is called **stochatsic resetting**.

How use in generative models????
