# To Do

[[Yifan Chen]] wants me to do the following

- [ ] Check the dimensional scaling of a Gaussian
      ![[2026-01-16 dimensional scaling.png]]See this plot from Yifan's paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02987
- [ ] Compare the performance of the auto-tuned sampler on a properly conditioned regular HMC ((1)make the mass matrix the Hessian at the extrema, (2) make the mass matrix the true covariance of the distribution), and compare it to ours.

# Results
